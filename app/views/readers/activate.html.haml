        We have sent an email message to

        You should have received an email 
      containing a link that will automatically activate your account. If for some reason that doesn't work, you can also enter your email address and activation code here:
    - if @error
      %p.haserror
        @error
    - form_for :reader, :url => reader_activate_url, :html => {:class => 'friendly'} do |f|
      %p
        %label{:for => "email"}
          Email Address
          %br
          = text_field_tag 'email', (params[:email] || (current_reader ? current_reader.email : '')), :class => 'standard'
      %p
        %label{:for => "activation_code"}
          Activation Code
          %br
          = text_field_tag :activation_code, '', :class => 'standard'
      %p
        = submit_tag 'Activate your account'
    %p
      If the activation message has gone astray, we can 
      = link_to 'send it again.', reader_reactivate_url
      If you think you might have put the wrong email address in, the easiest thing to do is 
      = link_to 'register again', reader_register_url
      with the right one. The failed registration attempt will be purged after a couple of days.
