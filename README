= Reader

Readers are logged-in visitors to whom you or your extensions can grant privileges. They don't see the admin interface: this is a way to control access to pages and extended functionality on the public site, not in radiant proper. A person can have both user and reader logins, and the administrator may find it useful to do just that.

With this extension you get a simple but complete machinery of registration, login and user-management (by the admin and by the users themselves). It includes input validation, email address confirmation and password reset functionality. An email address spoofing box should prevent spam signups.

This isn't much use by itself but it provides a common core for more interesting added functionality: see (soon) spanner's Forum extension for discussions and page/blog comments, Groups extension for proper page-access control and Downloads extension for secure (nginx-based) access-controlled file downloads. More will follow.

###Installation

Reader requires share_layouts and the spanner fork of multi_site from github. To install the extension, just run 
 
	rake production db:migrate:extensions
	rake production radiant:extensions:reader:update

The update task will install a /stylesheets/admin/reader.css that you can probably ignore and a /stylesheets/reader.css that you should call from your reader layout (see below) and feel free to modify.

###Configuration

Reader adds a few administrative columns to the site table: 

* reader_layout determinds the layout used to present reader pages and defaults to 'Main' or the first layout it finds in that site.
* email_from_name and email_from_address determine from whom and where the administrative email sent to readers appear to come. They default to the name and email address of the owner of the site.

###Layouts

We use the very pleasing share_layouts extension to wrap the layout of your public site around the pages produced by the reader extension. The details of the layout are up to you: as long as it calls <r:content /> at some point, it'll work. The reader pages also define title and breadcrumbs parts that may be useful. The site edit form now includes a drop-down on which to choose the reader layout.

###Using readers in other extensions

...is the whole point. The readers admin pages are properly registered with the AdminUI as collections of parts, so you can override them in the same way as the other admin pages. 

I have half a dozen other extensions to publish over the next week or two. By the time I've finished doing that I should have a pretty good idea of what to write here...
