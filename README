= Reader

Readers are logged-in visitors to whom you can grant privileges. They don't see the admin interface: this is a way to control access to pages and extended functionality on the public site. 

With this extension you get the basic machinery of registration, login and user-management (by the admin and by the users themselves). It's not much use by itself but it provides a common core for more interesting added functionality: see also spanner's Forum extension for discussions and page comments, Groups extension for proper page-access control and Downloads extension for secure (nginx-only) access-controlled file downloads. More will follow.

###Installation

To install the reader extension, just run 
 
	rake production db:migrate:extensions
	rake production radiant:extensions:reader:update

The update task will install a /stylesheets/admin/reader.css that you can probably ignore and a /stylesheets/reader.css that you should call from your reader admin layout (see below) and feel free to modify.
